## Course Overview

### Learning Objectives

**Conceptual Knowledge**
- Identify the fundamental concepts behind the formulation of equilibrium statistical physics and phase transitions.  
- Apply these concepts to a variety of complex and biological systems, such as binary mixtures, polymers, interfaces, and percolation problems.  
- Recognize the theory of percolation as a paradigmatic case of phase transition and understand the phenomenology of other related processes.  
- Understand the essential aspects of equilibrium and dynamics in phase transitions.  
- Become familiar with the phenomenology of **active matter**.

**Skills and Competencies**
- Master modern formalisms used for the treatment of physico-statistical systems.  
- Learn and apply analytical and stochastic simulation methods in the domain of statistical physics.
